This project works with data generated out of https://github.com/kushieda-minori/vc_file_grouper.

The active working page for the calculator is hosted by [Github Pages](https://kushieda-minori.github.io/vc-arcana-calc/)
but you can run a local copy from your own computer as long as you have the [index.html](index.html),
 [card info file](cardInfo.js), and [code.js](code.js). Simply download the files to the same location and open the
index.html file in your favorite web browser. Optionally download the [style.css](style.css) to enable different looks.

In general, I have tried to keep the source of this project as simple as possible so it should be
easy for anyone to maintain as long as they have basic HTML and Javascript knowledge.

Feedback is always welcome.
